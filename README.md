# Project 3: Community learning

In this project, you will be doing unsupervised learning on an online dataset.

This can be done either using any of the techniques that you have learnt in this module, such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, NLP word/sentence/paragraph/etc. 

This project is **fully open-ended**, I encourage you to be creative.

## Requirements

- You generate a new dataset from an online API or scraping. No pre-made datasets!
- You are expected to be working on some form of **TEXT DATA** - and not just numerical data
- You discover underlying clusters (social communities, market patterns, etc.) using unsupervised learning tools we've seen in class (clustering, dimensionality reduction, pre-trained word embeddings, network embedding, etc.)
- Produce a visualization in 2d or 3d of the data with the clusters you found tagged. See reddit example below.
- Analyze the produced clusters and use them to provide a short explanation of what you found.

**You don't have to do it at a large scale**

The data for these sort of projects can run very large if you let them, making the enterprise difficult.

You can limit yourself to samples of the communities you're looking at rather than the entire thing.

Please focus on exploring multiple techniques, understanding which ones would be most applicable, and interpreting the final results.
